First raw data
- pos:
-- data collection did work
-- I see up and downs in the data itself
-- works for both the beckenrand and the further-away use case, both with display attached and also bare PicoW
- neg:
-- not that easy to judge whether a lane was done or not
-- can't simply rely on the out of range
-- unclear on how to go on, data analysis wise...
- proposed model:
-- need to do analysis based on two linear approximations (over the last ~60 seconds for 25m)
--- need to see both a negative slope and a positive slope with about 20 dBm difference between highest and lowest
--- ave2 is sufficient for smoothing stuff

in this 60 seconds window: if
- the middle value is equal to the min of all values
- the oldest entry is ~20dBm higher than this min
- the newest entry is ~20dBm higher than this min
==> then we have a laneCount increase and can clear the window



-- check for differences in the range of 15 dBm (average 2 away) or 25 dBm (average 2, edge)
--> already shows an issue, I don't know where the receiver will be placed and one criteria (15) does not work for the other (25)...
