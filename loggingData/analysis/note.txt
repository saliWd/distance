First raw data
- pos:
-- data collection did work
-- I see up and downs in the data itself
-- works for both the beckenrand and the further-away use case
- neg:
-- not that easy to judge whether a lane was done or not
-- can't simply rely on the out of range
-- unclear on how to go on, data analysis wise...
- proposed model:
-- check for differences in the range of 15 dBm (average 2 away) or 25 dBm (average 2, edge)
--> already shows an issue, I don't know where the receiver will be placed and one criteria (15) does not work for the other (25)...
